    <p>There are two kinds of cooks, those who cook from recipes and those who just add a little of this and a little of that. We are in the former category, unfortunately. Because following a recipe takes time. We find ourselves inexcusably flipping back and forth to the phone (why not print it out after the 5th time making it?), taking it off sleep, and checking ad infinitum whether it was 1 tbsp or 1 tsp of garam masala.
</p>
<p>
Don’t get us wrong. We love recipe books. They inspire us as well as guide us. But nothing quite beats the time-saving of going into the kitchen and being able to pull out exactly what you need in a second because you simply know all the ingredients and all the tools you’ll need without having to reference a device or a book once. So for those of you who feel you don’t have “time” to cook, here’s a suggestion: memorize a recipe. Just one or two. You will be amazed at how fast something can go.

            <p>It won’t surprise anyone who knows us that our “one” is based on Nestle tollhouse cookies, but then with some little additions. We can whip up this batter from walking in the kitchen to stirring in the chips (yes, we are excluding cooking time, but more on that later…) in less than 10 minutes.

            <p>People like getting the dough even better than the cooked cookies. Why do they need cookies when they already have planned for a dessert? Then there’s awkwardness of feeling like they have to serve them then and there, even if it doesn’t fit with their overall plan.

                So, no, it’s not dinner for 4 (and it’s probably worth memorizing one of those go to dishes, too).</p>
